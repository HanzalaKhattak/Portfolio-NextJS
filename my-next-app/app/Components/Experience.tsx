          I was a MERN Stack Developer with 7 months of hands-on experience while learning and building full-stack web applications. Over this period, I gained practical skills in JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to create responsive, modern, and user-friendly interfaces.

On the backend, I worked with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and MySQL to develop secure APIs, manage databases, and build scalable server-side logic. I learned authentication, API integration, state management, and performance optimization while following clean-code and best development practices.

My focus has been on creating real-world solutions with smooth user experiences, strong functionality, and reliable performance across the full development lifecycle.
